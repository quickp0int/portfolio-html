		<p>Well to be completely honest, I was tired of a few things: redesigning my portfolio website every few years to fit the current trends, paying a couple of hundred dollars every year for hosting, domain registration and content management through Squarespace, and investing a lot of effort into maintaining an "online presence".</p>
		<p>So I decided to go the opposite way - a super simple site that is easy to maintain, cheap to host and runs locally to show to people without Internet.</p>
		<p>The site uses PHP for templating, has strictly no Javascript/Google Analytics and the CSS weighs 3kb.</p>
		<p>If instead of spending 552$ over 3 years on Squarespace, I had put that money on BTC, I'd be enjoying an extra 3138$ in my investment portfolio.</p>
		<p>Now I spend 20$/year on hosting. And my only social media presence is on <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/shinji-pons/" target="_blank">Linkedin</a>.</p>
