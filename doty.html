		<h1>Designs of the Year App</h1>
	</section>
	<section class="project-description">
		<p>If you took a walk around the Designs of the Year 2015 exhibit in the Design Museum you would have seen winning  designs from categories that included architecture, product, graphics, fashion and transport. The winners ranged from the BMW i8 to vegetables to the largest ocean clean-up in history.</p>
		<p>In addition to the carefully curated selection of nominees and winners, you would have also seen a large white table fitted with 40 Lumia 640 XLs which were flanked on either sides by Surface Tablets.</p>
 		<p>An instructional demo was played on the Surface tablets showing visitors how to use the interactive space, while the orange Lumia devices were there just begging to be picked up. Each of the six category winners throughout the exhibit included pedestals with Orange tags urging you to "tap here".</p>
 		<p>Visitors were then free to walk around the newly enhanced space with a Lumia in hand to tap on each NFC podium to discover more information and interactivity about each of the category winners. The information included further background about the product, the materials used, the productâ€™s designers, what the judges thought about the design, and why it was a category winner.</p>
 		<p>Over the six month period more than 10 million data events were collected from the 7, 896 visitors who engaged with the digital exhibition. That was a 31% take up from the total number of visitors to the museum resulting in 3,500 hours of usage.</p>
 		<p>The SceneSkope platform not only facilitates the delivery of the digital experience to the visitors but it also collects visitor interactions, behaviours and provides insights to the exhibit success and engagement. This approach helps the museum to tailor digital experiences and manage future exhibitions. For example, in total 19,392 taps were recorded within the exhibit.  From these "taps" visitor dwell time and footfall highlighting the most and least popular paths around the exhibit.</p>
		<p>Of the most engaged visitors 674 hours were spent in the exhibition space, with 273 hours of this representing content engagement. 25 hours were spent consuming audio and video, 11 hours engaging in debate, with nearly 10,000 words used by visitors to comment on the transport exhibit alone. The platform provides a dynamic way to communicate and engage visitors but also allows deep understanding of consumer behaviours.</p>
