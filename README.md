# Portfolio website
This is the repo for my personal portfolio website.

## Requirements
You must install node on your system to run the task runner, process the html and css.

## How to run the website locally
Download the repository and unpack it. If you already have node installed, you need to install gulp globally using npm install -g gulp.
Then install the necessary packages by running npm install when inside of the directory.
If everything is set up correctly, you should just be able to show the website by running: gulp
