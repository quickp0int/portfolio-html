# Portfolio website
This is the repo for my personal portfolio website.

## Requirements
You must install node on your system to run the task runner, process the html and css.

## How to run the website locally
1. Download the repository and unpack it.
2. If you already have node installed, you need to install gulp globally using <code>npm install -g gulp</code>
3. Install the necessary packages by running <code>npm install</code> when inside of the directory
4. If everything is set up correctly, you should just be able to show the website by running <code>gulp</code>
