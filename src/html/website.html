		<p>Well to be completely honest, I was tired of a few things: redesigning my portfolio website every few years to fit the current trends, paying a couple of hundred dollars every year for hosting, domain registration and content management through Squarespace, and investing a lot of effort into maintaining an "online presence".</p>

		<p>So I decided to go the opposite way - a super simple site that is easy to maintain, cheap to host and runs locally to show to people without Internet.</p>
		
		<p>The site uses gulp for templating, has strictly no Javascript/Google Analytics and the CSS weighs 5kb.</p>
