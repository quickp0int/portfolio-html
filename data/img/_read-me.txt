// About the folder structure:
If there is only one folder of the same name, then it contains the large images.
If there are two folders of the same name, the one with the 'raw' suffix contains the full size, uncompressed images.

// How to convert from the large images folder to the web friendly folder:
	Download XnConvert (https://www.xnview.com/en/xnconvert/). It's free and cross-platform.
	Load the input folder one by one
	Action
		Resize
		Mode: Width - 2000 pixels
		Leave "use gamma correction" unchecked
		Enlarge/Reduce: Reduce only
		Resample: Lanczos (this was the default)
	Output
